NISIMS was originally created to be a comprehensive tool by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) to standardize the collection of invasive species data. NPS adopted the BLMâ€™s data management system for invasive species to standardize the collection and management of exotic plant data collected by the Exotic Plant Management Teams (EPMT). NISIMS was identified as an appropriate replacement for the Alien Plant Control and Monitoring database (APCAM), the previous exotic plant data management system, because it requires the input of data identified as important to collect by NPS, and also includes a spatial component that allows for the mapping and further analysis of infestations. Further, NISIMS was chosen due to its potential for standardizing exotic plant data management across DOI agencies."
